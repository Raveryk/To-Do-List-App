# To-Do List App

Duration: 3 day weekend challenge

## Description

My project is a to-do list app that allows you to list out items with an attached due date. It shows you if you have completed that task or not and has buttons to update your list to show that a task has been completed and to delete a task after completion or due to another reason. After you complete a task a notification will pop up to celebrate your task completion and to display when you completed that task. If you decide to delete a task, another notification will pop up to ask you to confirm this decision. This app can become your new best friend to make sure that you keep your tasks in order and to give you a little boost to show you that you've moved one task closer to completed your errands list.

## Prerequisites
 - jQuery 
 - Bootstrap
 - Express/Node.js
 - 

 ## Installation

 1. Download project onto computer
 2. Download/install prerequisite software
 3. Create a database named 'weekend-to-do-app' and copy and paste database.sql queries into the database and execute them.
    The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
 4. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
 5. Run npm start to start up the server!
 6. Go to localhost:8000 in your browser and enjoy the app in all its glory!

 ## Usage

1. Enter a task into the first input field and pick a due date. Then press the 'Add Task' button.
2. The task will display under the To-Do List and will show a due date, if it has been completed or not, a 'Completed' button, and a 'Delete' button.
3. If you complete a task, click the 'Completed' button - you will receive an alert notifying you that you completed the task and when you did so.
4. If you want to delete a task, completed or not, then press the 'Delete' button. This will prompt an alert asking you to make sure that you do in fact want to delete this task.

## Built With:
